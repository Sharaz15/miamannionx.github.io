<p>I made it using Jekyll due to itâ€™s ease of integration with GitHub pages.</p>

<p>The theme I used is called console, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console">here</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m enjoying using markdown to write these blog posts. I wrote all the notes I took during training at my internship in markdown and it really grew on me.</p>
