# Corporate Social Responsibility Days at Publicis Sapient

I was given the opportunity to work with a small team of fellow interns to organise two Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) days for all of the interns.

There was a big group of interns (80 of us!) which turned out to be a challenge to organise charity events for. We reached out to countless charities looking for volunteering opportunities, but most said it was too late notice or they didn't have enough spaces.

So for the first of our two CSR days, we organised a sponsored walk around London! It was for a homeless charity, and we managed to fundraise over Â£1000, which was a great acheivement!

Here's a picture of my team halfway through our sponsored walk in Chinatown:

We did the second CSR day today. We really wanted at least some of the interns to volunteer at a charity, so I reached out to the food bank I volunteer at. It was lucky I already volunteered there, as if I didn't already have standing contacts and connections, I doubt I would have been able to organise it. We had 20 interns volunteer at Felix Project food banks across London, here is a picture I took of my team at the Deptford branch:

The rest of the interns did a park clean up, which was very successful too.

I'm so glad that today went well with the food bank volunteering, everyone really enjoyed it even though it was hard work! The Deptford warehouse was short on volunteers today as well, so they were really grateful for our help. I'm glad the rest of the interns were able to see how much of an impact our work had and many of them promised to come back to volunteer again, which was amazing to hear.

I enjoyed helping organise the CSR days. It seemed natural to volunteer to help out with them as I enjoy volunteering a lot in my free time already. It's definitely something I'd like to continue helping out with at the workplace I go to when I graduate.
