# Big Data Streaming Project: Internship wrap up and reflections

It's the final week of my summer Software Engineering internship and we've finally finished our project.

They also wanted us to integrate big data somehow and it was up to us to design and develop the product.

Being able to design and develop an entire system from scratch was an amazing opportunity. No one on my team had any previous experience with working with big data before, or any of the recommended tech stack (Microsoft Azure).

The software architecture we decided on was this:
