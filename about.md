# A bit about me

I'm in my final year of Computer Science at the University of Warwick, spending a lot my time working on my dissertation project and other university work. After getting some experience in the industry this summer, I'm working hard to become a software engineer. 

Outside of studying, I'm the secretary for my university's Craft Society. I love helping to organise these events, which welcome people of all abilities and levels of experience. Craft society has become increasingly popular in recent years, as craft-oriented hobbies are becoming increasingly widespread and more people are realising their positive impact on mental wellbeing. I'm having great fun brainstorming and organising these events. Check out our SU website [here](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/craft/).

I also spend a lot of my free time volunteering. It's something I started doing in lockdown and have continued since. I volunteer at my local food bank, with the [Felix Project](https://thefelixproject.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwsfuYBhAZEiwA5a6CDLiFXQIhxy6hO8nWLHDeY9XtKc5I1epUlRqhyZVrHQD2zqxCOHGccxoC8msQAvD_BwE) in Deptford, London. When I'm at university I enjoy participating in Warwick Volunteer events. These events have given me the opportunity to volunteer and partake in activities I've never had access to before, wildflower planting in local community green spaces being just one example.

Some of my long-standing personal hobbies include drawing, reading, pilates and going to the gym. I'm hoping in the future to expand this website further and have a section dedicated to these more personal activities of mine.
