## Welcome to my website!
I made it using Jekyll due to it's ease of integration with GitHub pages.

The theme I used is called console, which can be found [here](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

I'm enjoying using markdown to write these blog posts. I wrote all the notes I took during training at my internship in markdown and it really grew on me.
